# Image_recoginition
This is my first image recoginition program. This problem is on Deep Learning and Neural Network programming exercises of Coursera.
Here we will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats. 
This model will step through how to do this classification using a Neural Network mindset, and will also hone your intuitions about deep learning.
